# Nmap Vulnerability Assessment – Shashank Budhlakoti

## Objective
To identify open ports, active services, OS fingerprint, and security vulnerabilities using advanced Nmap scanning techniques.

## Tools Used
- Nmap  
- Linux Terminal  
- WHOIS  
- Netcat  
- NSE Scripts  

## Commands Used
- `nmap -sn <IP>` (Host discovery)  
- `nmap -sV <IP>` (Service detection)  
- `nmap -A <IP>` (Aggressive scan)  
- `nmap --script vuln <IP>` (Vulnerability scan)  

## Key Findings
- Open ports detected  
- Outdated services identified  
- Weak security configurations  
- Possible OS fingerprint match  

## Outcome
Learned practical reconnaissance, port enumeration, and vulnerability scanning used in real VAPT engagements.
